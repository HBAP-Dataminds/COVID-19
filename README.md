# COVID-19

This repository is designed for use by the Harvard Business Analytics Program (HBAP) students and their effort to contribute to combating this pandemic. Our varied backgrounds paired with the offerings in this program, give us unique insights and analytical capabilies that we are using to help understand this virus from a data driven perspective.

This will serve as the central location for all things related to COVID-19 including Kaggle competitions and other work

This is the collaborative space where we can share data, notebooks, thoughts, etc regarding the COVID-19 virus

Data is organized by source and will be updated daily.

## Projects
# Covid-19 Knowledge Graph
This project is designed to see if we can uncover realtionships and mechanism in data realted to COVID-19. Using a varierty of unstractureed data from Kaggel, CDC, DrugBank and Nextstrain.org, we are loading this into a graph database as node and edges. We are using Natural Language Processing to extract out bio-medical terms and lining them to their interactions with drugs. Ultimately this will allow to have a central database where we can perform analysis using Graph Analytics to find information such as the degree on centrality for a term or if we can predict links between nodes (possible drug treatments)

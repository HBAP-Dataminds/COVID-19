Z.",Investigation of potential Chinese materia medica and its monomers in treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor,"Objective: To investigate the mechanism of treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine and monomers with ACE2 as receptor. Methods： Chinese materia medica and monomers acting on angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor was retrieved by TCMSP database. UniProt, GeneCards and other databases were used to query the gene names corresponding to the target of Chinese medicine monomer, and then Cytoscape 3.6.1 was used to construct the compound-target (gene) network. DAVID was used to carry out the gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict its mechanism of action. Results： There were 54 targets in the puerarin-target network, including AKT1, VEGFA, TNF, etc. GO function enrichment analysis revealed 554 GO items (P   0.05), including 486 biological process (BP) items, 26 cell component (CC) items, and 42 molecular function (MF) items. There were 162 signaling pathways (P   0.05) involved in small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renin-angiotensin system pathway, etc. The results of molecular docking showed that the affinity of puerarin with ACE2 and hydrolase of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the recommended drugs. Conclusion: Puerarin may regulate multiple signaling pathways by binding ACE2 to AGTR1, NOS3, HIF1A and other targets and regulating multiple signaling pathways, which may have therapeutic effects on COVID-19.",2020,Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs,51,5,1123-1129,,10.7501/j.issn.0253-2670.2020.05.005,http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2005541908 http://dx.doi.org/10.7501/j.issn.0253-2670.2020.05.005,World Health Organization,World Health Organization,,

Hematopoietic system can also be affected by COVID19. Thrombocytopenia at admission was prevalent, while late phase or delayed phase thrombocytopenia is obscure. This retrospective case series analyzed patients with COVID19 at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 25th to March 9th, 2020. Analysis began on March 11th, 2020. COVID19 associated delayed phase thrombocytopenia was occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolled patients. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher ICU admission rate. Delayed phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a high and significantly negative linear correlation with B cell percentages and serum IL 6 levels. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes. We speculated that the delayed phase platelet destruction might be mediated by antibodies, and suggest immunoregulatory treatment in severe patients to improve outcomes. Besides, clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3 to 4 weeks after symptom onset.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Methods: We tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results: 34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization. Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is funded by the Project for Emergency of Key R &amp;amp; D Plan from Zhejiang Science and Technology Agency (2020C03123).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.",2020,Thoracic Cancer,n/a,n/a,,,10.1111/1759-7714.13424,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13424,World Health Organization,World Health Organization,,

The Chinese medicine prevention programs for COVID-19 were collected and searched from the official website of the Health Commission and State Administration Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the country and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. TCM prevention programs in 17 provinces including Heilongjiang, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan, etc were received. A total of 82 herbs were included in 64 prescriptions, the most frequently used Chinese herbs were Astragalus membranaceus, Lonicera japonica, etc. Tonifying deficiency drugs with sweet and warm natures were used the most, the Chinese herbs distributed in the lung channel was the most in channel tropism drugs. Analysis by association rule, eight combinations of commonly used drugs were obtained. Based on entropy clustering method rule analysis, seven potential new prescriptions were obtained. Tonifying deficiency drugs are often used in various places to prevent COVID-19, focusing on the lung, spleen and stomach.

The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment. Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.",2020,Theranostics,10,10,4606-4613,,10.7150/thno.45016,http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631398879 http://dx.doi.org/10.7150/thno.45016,World Health Organization,World Health Organization,,
